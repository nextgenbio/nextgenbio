## The first workshop

The first workshop will run on the 3rd-5th (Monday-Wednesday inclusive) of July 2017. It will be aimed at researchers with limited or no previous experience in programming and data analysis but who need these approaches in their research. If you are not sure if you are in this group, consider the following example.

Given the file `test.txt`:
~~~
> less test.txt
Apple
Banana
Kiwi
Watermelon
~~~

What is the output of the `bash` command:

`> cat test.txt | wc -lm`

If the file `text.txt` is read into `R`:

`test <- read.table(file = “test.txt”, header = FALSE)`

What is the output of:

`> str(test)`

If you know the answers to these questions on top of your head, you are likely not the target audience for this workshop.

### Venue

[The University Of Leeds](http://leeds.ac.uk), [Leeds, UK](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/University+of+Leeds/@53.8066846,-1.5572268,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48795c02da8a25af:0xd388478487e96af9!8m2!3d53.8066815!4d-1.5550328?hl=en), [Fourman Cluster (room 8.49), Worsley Building, Clarendon Way, Leeds LS2 9JT](https://it.leeds.ac.uk/info/76/clusters/527/fourman).

### Costs

The workshop is free of charge for all BBSRC-funded researchers, as well as staff and students from the Universities of Leeds and Huddersfield. For all other participants a course fee of £170 will apply that will need to be paid before the workshop begins. Travel and accommodation costs are not covered by the organisers.

### Format of the course

The format of the materials and the nature of the delivery will be based on the successful [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) blended-learning model, where students learn by developing skills through hands-on live coding and peer programming sessions led by experienced instructors and supported by a small team of helpers. The workshop is limited to 25 participants.

### Preliminary programme:

- **Monday**

Introduction to the fundamentals of UNIX shell and software development and best practices, delivered using Python but easily transferable to other programming languages.

- **Tuesday**

Introduction to fundamentals of R and R Studio, including data and analysis reproducibility, concluded with example analysis of gene expression data.

- **Wednesday** 

A "hackathon" day, during which participants will use skills learned in earlier days to solve a real-life data analysis problem of their choosing.

The detailed programme will be available shortly before the beginning of the course.
