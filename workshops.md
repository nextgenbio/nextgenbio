### Venue

The University Of Leeds, Leeds, UK.

### Costs

The workshop is open to all. All BBSRC-funded researchers will be eligible for free fees.

For all other participants a course fee of £170 will apply that will need to be paid before the workshop begins.

### Format of the course

The format of the materials and the nature of the delivery will be based on the successful "Software Carpentry"(http://software-carpentry.org/) blended-learning model where students learn by developing skills through hands-on live coding and peer programming sessions led by experienced instructors and supported by a small team of helpers.


Tuesday 11th and Wednesday 12th : Introduction to the fundamentals of software development and best practices, delivered using Python but easily transferable to other programming languages; all tasks will be demonstrated using live coding by the instructors and practiced hands–on by each participant.

Thursday 13th :“Hackathon” day, participants will use skills learned in days 1 & 2 to solve a real-life scientific problem of their choosing.
