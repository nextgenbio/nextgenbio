## Registration is open for the Cloud Computing workshop

We are happy to announce the next workshop in our "Next Generation Biologists" series. During **two days in January 16-17 (Thursday and Friday) at the University of Leeds**, we will give a gentle introduction to using remote computers and running some genomic analyses on HPC clusters "in the cloud". While it's beneficial if you know some shell already, please contact us if you're unsure if this workshop is for you.

Application procedure and more information is available at [nextgenbiologists.org](http://nextgenbiologists.org). Given the coming holiday break **there is no deadline for applications - you can apply up to a day before the course**. We will be sending confirmations of attendance from January 6th, 2020.  Go ahead and [read all about the workshop](/workshops/) as well as about [who is running the project](/about/) and [how to apply](/application/) (or you can [jump straight to the registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GmLuhnPvx8HjilFx5sr59zc29PADULuB3zWWuquNogM/viewform?edit_requested=true)).

We are looking forward to reading your applications :-)
