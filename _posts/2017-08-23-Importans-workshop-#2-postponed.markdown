## Workshop #2 is postponed until December

Dear everyone,

due to previously unscheduled commitments of the workshop instructors, we unfortunately have to postpone the workshop #2. We are currently working on a new date for the next workshop, which is likely to be in December (also in Huddersfield). We very much apologise for this change and hope you will still join us in winter.

Mary, Martin and Jarek
