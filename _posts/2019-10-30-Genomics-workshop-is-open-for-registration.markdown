## Registration is open for the Genomics workshop

After the summer break, we are very happy to announce the next workshop in our "Next Generation Biologists" series. During **two days in December 16-17 (Monday and Tuesday) at the University of Leeds**, we will inaugrate The Carpentries' Genomics workshop, covering use of command line to analyse genomic data from high-throughput sequencing and a gentle introduction to cloud computing. _This workshop has no entry requirements._

Application procedure and more information is available at [nextgenbiologists.org](http://nextgenbiologists.org). **Application deadline is at midnight on Monday 23rd November**. Go ahead and [read all about the workshop](/workshops/) as well as about [who is running the project](/about/) and [how to apply](/application/) (or you can [jump straight to the registration form](https://forms.gle/oAxNbNuZf6ZzucKR7)).
