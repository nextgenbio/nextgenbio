## Registration is open for workshop #5 and #6

This time we are announcing two workshops, the final two of our workshops for beginners. The fifth workshop will take place **at the University of Huddersfield on the 12-14th December (Wed-Fri)**. The sixth workshop will take place **at the University of Leeds on the 16-18th January (Wed-Fri)**. Given the Christmas break period, we are announcing the application for them simultaneously; you will be able to select which date you prefer during the registration. **Application deadline is at midnight on Monday 19th November**. Go ahead and [read all about the workshop](/workshops/) as well as about [who is running the project](/about/) and [how to apply](/application/) (or you can [jump straight into the registration form]()).

We are looking forward to reading your applications :-)
