## Registration is open for the first Advanced NGB workshopÂ§

We are happy to announce the first of two workshops on the Advanced concepts in our Next Generation Biologists series, which will take place **at the University of Leeds on the 17-18th June (Mon-Tue)**. In this context, "Advanced" means:

- Day 1: HPC in a day (using a spun-up-for-the-occasion cloud-based HPC cluster)
- Day 2: Cloud Computing in a day (setting up your own RStudio server in the clound, look at the Machine Learning tools and a tour at the Google Genomics/AWS Genomics/Azure Genomics platforms.

These workshops require the participants to be familiar with command line tools! **Application deadline is at midnight on Monday 3rd June**. Go ahead and [read all about the workshop](/workshops/) as well as about [who is running the project](/about/) and [how to apply](/application/) (or you can [jump straight to the registration form](https://forms.gle/jd5sym9nz8W7NjnK7)).

We are looking forward to reading your applications :-)
