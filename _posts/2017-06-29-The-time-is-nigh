## The end (of waiting) is nigh!

The time is coming - our first workshop begins in just 4 days :-) The email went out with the preliminary plans and installation instructions (FYI [https://arctraining.github.io/2017-07-03-ngb-leeds/](https://arctraining.github.io/2017-07-03-ngb-leeds/)), the sandwiches and coffee are arranged - see you all on Monday! And don't forget your laptop chargers :-)
