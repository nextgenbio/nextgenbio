## The next workshop

The next workshop will run on 16-17th December 2019 at the University of Leeds. It will cover project organisation, command line for the analysis of next-generation sequencing data and introduction to cloud computing.

### Venue

[The University of Leeds](http://leeds.ac.uk), building and room TBA.

### Costs

The workshop is free of charge for all BBSRC-funded researchers, as well as staff and students from the Universities of Leeds and Huddersfield (whether they are BBSRC funded or not). For all other participants a course fee of £100 will apply that will need to be paid before the workshop begins. Travel and accommodation costs are **not** covered by the organisers.

### Format of the course

The format of the materials and the nature of the delivery will be based on the successful [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) blended-learning model, where students learn by developing skills through hands-on live coding and peer programming sessions led by experienced instructors and supported by a small team of helpers. The workshop is limited to 25 participants; they will be expected to bring their own computers to the workshop.

### Preliminary programme:

- **Monday**

Command line for organisation and analysis of high-throughput sequencing data

- **Tuesday**

Introduction to cloud computing

The detailed programme will be available shortly before the beginning of the course.
