## About the project



## The workshops

Over the course of the project, we will run 10 workshops covering topics ranging from the basics of UNIX shell and R to high-performance and cloud computing. The first three workshops will be aimed at novices and will introduce Unix shell, R, Python and concepts of data reproducibility. These workshops will take place in July, September and January (2018), with the dates for the remaining workshops announced later.
